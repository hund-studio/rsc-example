# React Server Component Example

This repository is a demonstration of implementing React Server Components without using additional frameworks. It is based on "experimental" modules, so its long-term stability is not guaranteed, but it can serve as a starting point for those looking to experiment.

Key features include:

Built entirely as ESM (ECMAScript Modules) to ensure maximum interoperability with libraries released exclusively as ESM (e.g., mdx).
Uses esbuild to generate bundles and includes some workarounds for known issues.
Fully implemented in TypeScript.

## Quickstart

To get started with this repository, simply clone it and run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port `3000`.
